# ABSTRACT

This project implements a web crawling, indexing, and query processing system using Python. It consists of three main components: a Scrapy-based web crawler for downloading web documents in HTML format, a Scikit-Learn-based indexer for constructing an inverted index with TF-IDF score representation and cosine similarity calculation, and a Flask-based processor for handling free text queries in JSON format.

The objectives of this project are to demonstrate the implementation of a web crawling system to collect web documents, construct an inverted index for efficient search indexing, and provide a query processing mechanism to retrieve relevant documents based on user queries. 

The next steps involve further optimization of the indexing and querying algorithms, as well as enhancing the user interface for better usability.

# OVERVIEW

The project encompasses three main components: a web crawler, an indexer, and a query processor. Each component plays a crucial role in the system's functionality, contributing to the collection, organization, and retrieval of web-based information. Below is a detailed explanation of each part:

Web Crawler:-

The web crawler serves as the initial step in the data acquisition process. It systematically navigates through web pages, retrieving HTML documents from various sources based on predefined rules. In this project, the web crawler is implemented using Scrapy, a powerful web crawling and scraping framework in Python.

**Functionality:**

- Initialization: The crawler is initialized with a seed URL/domain, maximum pages to crawl, and maximum depth of crawling.
- Traversing: It follows links on web pages according to specified rules, recursively traversing through the website's structure.
- Downloading: The crawler downloads HTML documents from visited pages and saves them for further processing.
- Rule-based Navigation: Rules are defined to control which links to follow and which to ignore, ensuring focused and efficient crawling.

Indexer:-

The indexer processes the downloaded HTML documents to create an organized and searchable index. It extracts relevant information from the documents, assigns weights to terms using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) representation, and constructs an inverted index for efficient retrieval. This component utilizes Scikit-Learn, a popular machine learning library in Python, for its implementation.

**Functionality:**

- Document Processing: Extracts textual content from HTML documents, such as titles, prices, and availability, to create document representations.
- TF-IDF Representation: Utilizes TF-IDF vectorization to assign weights to terms based on their frequency in each document and rarity across the corpus.
- Cosine Similarity Calculation: Computes cosine similarity scores between user queries and indexed documents, facilitating relevance ranking.
- Inverted Index Construction: Organizes terms and their corresponding document identifiers into an inverted index structure for efficient search operations.

Query Processor:-

The query processor acts as the user-facing interface for information retrieval. It accepts user queries, validates them, and retrieves relevant documents from the index based on the provided input. This component is implemented using Flask, a lightweight and extensible web framework for Python.

**Functionality:**

- User Interaction: Provides a web-based interface for users to input free text queries in JSON format.
- Query Validation: Validates user input to ensure proper formatting and completeness before processing.
- Top-K Result Retrieval: Retrieves the top-K ranked search results based on cosine similarity scores between the query and indexed documents.
- Result Formatting: Formats the retrieved results for presentation to the user, including document titles and corresponding similarity scores.

By integrating these three components, the system enables users to efficiently search and retrieve relevant information from a collection of web documents. The web crawler acquires data, the indexer organizes it into an easily searchable format, and the query processor facilitates user interaction and retrieval of desired content. Together, they form a robust information retrieval system capable of handling diverse web-based queries.

The project draws upon existing literature and techniques in the fields of web crawling, information retrieval, and web-based systems. Key references include:

- "Introduction to Information Retrieval" by Christopher D. Manning, Prabhakar Raghavan, and Hinrich Schütze: This comprehensive textbook provides foundational knowledge on information retrieval techniques, including indexing, retrieval models, and evaluation methodologies.
- "Web Scraping with Python" by Ryan Mitchell: This book offers practical guidance on web scraping techniques using Python, covering topics such as crawling, parsing HTML content, and handling website structures.
- "Scikit-Learn Documentation": The official documentation of Scikit-Learn provides valuable insights into the usage of machine learning algorithms for text processing, including TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity calculations.
- "Flask Documentation": The Flask documentation serves as a reference for developing web applications in Python, covering topics such as routing, request handling, and template rendering.

The proposed system comprises a web crawler for retrieving HTML documents, an indexer for creating a searchable index using TF-IDF vectorization, a query processor for handling user queries and retrieving relevant documents, and a Flask-based web application for user interaction, offering a seamless experience for information retrieval from web sources.

# DESIGN

**System Capabilities**

- Web crawling: The system is capable of crawling web pages starting from a seed URL/domain, with options to specify the maximum number of pages and maximum depth of crawling.
- Indexing: The system constructs an inverted index from the crawled HTML documents, utilizing TF-IDF score representation for efficient search indexing.
- Query processing: The system provides a query processing mechanism to retrieve relevant documents based on user queries, utilizing cosine similarity for ranking.

**Interactions**

The web crawler interacts with web servers to download HTML documents, while the indexer interacts with the downloaded documents to construct the inverted index. The query processor interacts with users through a web interface, accepting free text queries in JSON format and returning search results.

**Cautions**

- Scalability: While the system demonstrates effectiveness with small-scale datasets, scalability concerns may arise when dealing with large volumes of web documents. Optimization strategies and infrastructure upgrades may be necessary to handle increased load.
- Data Quality: The quality and consistency of web content can vary significantly, leading to inaccuracies in indexing and retrieval. Robust error-handling mechanisms and data validation procedures are essential to mitigate potential issues.
- Security: As the system interacts with external web sources and processes user inputs, security vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and injection attacks pose risks. Implementing stringent security measures, including input validation and sanitization, is crucial to safeguarding the system against malicious exploitation.

**Documentation:** 

The crawler starts from a given seed URL/Domain and follows links based on specified rules. It can crawl multiple pages simultaneously and can be configured to limit the number of pages and depth of crawling.

**Dependencies:**

Scrapy 2.11+: Open-source web crawling framework.

## Quickstart — How to run this project (macOS / zsh)

Follow these commands from the project root (`Project/`). They create a clean virtual environment, install dependencies, run the crawler (example), build the index, and start the Flask UI.

1) Create and activate a virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

2) Install project dependencies

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3) Run the Scrapy crawler (example)

# Example: crawl `books.toscrape.com` (limits: pages/depth are examples)
```bash
cd crawling
. ../.venv/bin/python -m scrapy crawl generic_crawler -a start_url=https://books.toscrape.com -a max_pages=50 -a max_depth=3
# After the run, output JSONL is written to `../crawling/output_docs.jsonl` (or `output.json`/`output.html` depending on spider).
cd ..
```

4) Build the TF-IDF index with the Scikit indexer

```bash
.venv/bin/python Scikit/indexer.py --docs crawling/output_docs.jsonl --out Scikit/index_output
# This writes `Scikit/index_output/` containing:
# - `tfidf_vectorizer.pkl` (the fitted TfidfVectorizer)
# - `tfidf_matrix.pkl` (document-term matrix)
# - `doc_meta.json`, `doc_order.json`, `inverted_index.json`
```

5) Start the Flask web UI (search interface)

```bash
.venv/bin/python zFlask/app.py
# Open http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your browser.
```

6) Batch query (CSV) endpoint example

```bash
# POST a CSV file with columns `qid,query` to the `/search_csv` endpoint
curl -F "file=@queries.csv" http://127.0.0.1:5000/search_csv -o results.csv
```

7) Git / publishing notes

```bash
# Push feature branch and create a PR on GitHub (recommended)
git checkout -b feature/ir-pipeline
git add -A && git commit -m "Add IR pipeline"
git push -u origin feature/ir-pipeline
# Then open GitHub and create a PR to merge into `main`.
```

Troubleshooting tips
- If Scrapy imports fail, run the spider with `python -m scrapy` from the activated venv (shown above).
- If you accidentally committed the virtualenv, remove it with:

```bash
git rm -r --cached .venv
echo ".venv/" >> .gitignore
git add .gitignore && git commit -m "Ignore virtualenv"
```

- If the Flask app cannot find the index files, ensure `Scikit/index_output/` exists and contains the required artifacts (`tfidf_vectorizer.pkl`, `tfidf_matrix.pkl`, `doc_order.json`, `doc_meta.json`).

Optional: Docker (advanced)

You can containerize the project for reproducible runs. Create a `Dockerfile` that: uses `python:3.11-slim`, copies source, installs `requirements.txt`, and runs the indexer and Flask app. Ask me and I will generate a minimal Dockerfile for you.
